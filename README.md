# Mouse Polling Rate Tester

## Overview

This Python script allows you to measure the polling rate of your mouse in a simple and straightforward manner. The polling rate, often measured in Hertz (Hz), represents the speed at which your mouse reports its position to the computer.

## How It Works

The script utilizes the `pynput` library to capture mouse movements. It calculates the polling rate by measuring the time elapsed between consecutive mouse movements. The result is displayed in HZ, giving you a real-time insight into your mouse's performance.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pynput
2. Run the script:
  python LatencyHZ.py
